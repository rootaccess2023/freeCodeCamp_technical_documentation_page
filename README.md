## Project Description

The technical documentation page is structured to provide an organized and accessible way to navigate through various sections of technical information. It includes a main content area, a navigation bar, and multiple sections each dedicated to a specific topic within the documentation.

## User Stories

### Main Content Area
- The main content area has an id of `main-doc`, which contains all the sections of the documentation.
- Each section within `main-doc` has a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five sections.

### Sections
- The first element within each `.main-section` is a header that describes the section's topic.
- Each `.main-section` has an id that corresponds to its header text, replacing spaces with underscores.
- There should be at least ten paragraph elements (`<p>`) and five code elements (`<code>`) within the `.main-section` elements.
- Each section should also contain at least five list items (`<li>`).

### Navigation Bar
- The navigation bar has an id of `navbar`.
- It includes a header element with the topic of the documentation and contains link elements (`<a>`) with the class `nav-link` for each section.
- The header in the `#navbar` comes before any link elements.
- Each `nav-link` text corresponds to the header text within its section.

### Responsive Design
- The page uses media queries to ensure it is responsive and provides a good user experience on various devices.
