                <h2> A useful analogy</h2>
                <p>The box model is complex to understand, so let's recap what you've learned with an analogy.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The content box is the artwork.</li>
                  <li>The padding box is the white matte, between the frame and the artwork.
                  </li>
                  <li>The border box is the frame, providing a literal border for the artwork.</li>
                  <li>The margin box is the space between each frame.</li>
                  <li>The shadow occupies the same space as the margin box.</li>
                </ul>
